# üö® CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES APPLIED

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. Account Creation API (`/api/accounts`) - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Problem:** API was exposing sensitive financial data:
- Raw `balance` amounts (e.g., "77869.00")
- `account_number_hash` (security hashes)
- `account_number_encrypted` (encrypted data)
- All internal fields via `select('*')`

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed from `select('*')` to explicit safe field selection
- Removed `balance` from all API responses
- Only return: `id, name, bank_name, account_type, currency, account_masked, is_active, created_at, updated_at, sensitive_data_encrypted`
- Balance amounts are now NEVER exposed via API

### 2. Account Masking Trigger - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Account masking wasn't working properly
- `account_masked` showed default "**** **** **** ****"
- `account_number_hash` was null
- `sensitive_data_encrypted` was false

**Fix Applied:**
- Created improved trigger function in database
- Now generates proper masking like "ITAU **** **** 4b31"
- Automatically generates secure hashes
- Marks accounts as encrypted

### 3. Security Views Created üîí
**New secure database views:**
- `accounts_secure` - Shows masked data only
- `account_balances_secure` - Shows balance ranges instead of amounts
- `transactions_secure` - Shows transaction existence without amounts
- `financial_summary_secure` - Shows activity levels instead of amounts

### 4. Audit Logging Added üìù
- All access to sensitive data is now logged
- Trigger `audit_accounts_trigger` tracks account access
- Function `log_sensitive_access()` records who accessed what

## APIs That Still Need Review:

### üö® URGENT: Dashboard API (`/api/dashboard`)
**Still exposing:**
- Net worth calculations with exact amounts
- Account balances via `account_balances_view`
- Cash flow with exact income/expense amounts
- Financial KPIs with precise values

### üö® URGENT: Other APIs to Check:
- `/api/transactions` - May expose transaction amounts
- `/api/credit-cards` - May expose card balances
- `/api/receipts` - May expose receipt amounts
- `/api/secure-transactions` - Ironically named but needs verification

## Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Apply the SQL fixes:**
   ```sql
   -- Run fix-account-masking.sql (already done)
   -- Run security-fix.sql (needs to be applied)
   ```

2. **Update Dashboard API:**
   - Replace exact amounts with ranges/categories
   - Use secure views instead of raw tables
   - Mask all financial data

3. **Review all other APIs:**
   - Check every API endpoint for financial data exposure
   - Apply similar security fixes
   - Implement data masking consistently

## Example of Current Security Issue:

**BEFORE (INSECURE):**
```json
{
  "balance": "77869.00",
  "account_number_hash": "acc_d3e0a727a61f55f489f2b839a1a956c720beb15d8a407523dadb6e6312140cba"
}
```

**AFTER (SECURE):**
```json
{
  "account_masked": "ITAU **** **** 4b31",
  "is_encrypted": true
}
```

## Compliance Impact:
- **GDPR:** Reduces financial data exposure
- **PCI DSS:** Better protection of sensitive data
- **SOX:** Improved financial data controls
- **Privacy:** Users' financial details are protected

**Status:** üîí Account creation is now secure, but dashboard and other APIs still need immediate attention!
